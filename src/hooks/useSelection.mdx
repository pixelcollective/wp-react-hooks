# useSelection

The `useSelection` hook provides a way of consuming and modifying which blocks are currently selected.

## Getting started

1. Import the hook.

```jsx
import {useSelection} from '@tinypixelco/wp-react-hooks'
```

2. Call the hook in the top-level of your component.

```jsx
const {selection, setSelection} = useSelection()
```

## selection

```js
import {useSelection} from '@tinypixelco/wp-react-hooks'

const component = () => {
  const {selection} = useSelection()

  return (
    <div>
      {selection && JSON.stringify(selection)}
    </div>
  )
}
````

The `selection` object looks like this:

```jsx
{
  attributes: {}
  clientId: "881d5ee3-1672-4607-8b65-1fa7877adf0d"
  innerBlocks: []
  isValid: true
  name: 'acme-co/acme-block'
}
```

## setSelection

This block will always be selected.

```jsx
import {useSelection} from '@tinypixelco/wp-react-hooks'

const component = ({clientId}) => {
  const {selection, setSelection} = useSelection()

  useEffect(() => {
    const notSelected = selection.clientId !== clientId

    if (notSelected) {
      setSelection(clientId)
    }
  }, [selection])

  return (
    <div>
      Annoyingly, this block is always selected.
    </div>
  )
}
```

Any actual use of `setSelection` would likely involve you:

- Getting the block ID you want to select through some means.
- Having some criteria that needs to be met to trigger the selection.
- Calling `setSelection` when that criteria is met.

But, this example allows us to demonstrate the functionality of the component in isolation.
