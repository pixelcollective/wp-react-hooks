# useBlockEditorStore

The `useBlockEditorStore` hook wraps `select` and `dispatch` on the `core/block-editor` store.

It is primarily intended to be used internally by wp-react-hooks, but it is also fine to import it.

## Import

```jsx
import {useBlockEditorStore} from '@tinypixelco/wp-react-hooks'
```

## Usage

```jsx
const {select, dispatch} = useBlockEditorStore()
```

### Source

```jsx
import {select, dispatch} from '@wordpress/data'

const useBlockEditorStore = () => ({
  select: select('core/block-editor'),
  dispatch: dispatch('core/block-editor'),
})

export {useBlockEditorStore}
```
